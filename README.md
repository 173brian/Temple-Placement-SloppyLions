### Our Goal
To find correlations for temple announcements, our team combined the Safegraph pattern data and the census data to observe current operating temple attendance traffic. After finding this correlation, we will see if there is a pattern between temple location, attendance, and major retail brands and their locations.
### How We Will Use The Data To Meet Our Goal

#### Explanation of the current SafeGraph data format and some descriptive visualizations
We will be manipulating the Safegraph data to determine the traffic at the temple locations and traffic at retail locations.

### Make our Analysis Marketable

Part of our plan for the project is to be able to market our final temple county predictions to specific groups. To do this we want to use some of the features we have engineered to find correlations between temple and these types of organizations. For example, below we have a sample of looking for correlation between the Costco in Boise, ID, and the Boise Idaho Temple. These charts are very basic and show a weak correlation currently. We want to look for more concrete evidence during the course of our project to help be able to market our overall Analysis.

We understand that the big ticket item of our analysis is the counties that we think are likely to be locations for our next temples. Yet, what good is that information if we can not convince people that it is important to know?

#### Explanation of the Census data

### Additional data that you will leverage beyond that found in the SafeGraph (if any)

### What Constitutes Success

Our team will succeed upon finding correlations between the presence of temples and indicators found in brand attendance data, or census data. We will be able to map the presence of these correlations.
