### Our Goal
To find correlations for temple announcements, our team combined the Safegraph pattern data and the census data to observe current operating temple attendance traffic. If there is a trend with certain temples having high usage and then a new temple to help relieve the traffic stress, we could anticipate that the brethren had a higher desire to create another temple in that area. The census data helps to create an estimated distance to the temple and each county's traffic to that particular temple.
### How We Will Use The Data To Meet Our Goal

#### Explanation of the current SafeGraph data format and some descriptive visualizations

TODO: Graph of attendance for a LDS location over a month

TODO: Graph of temple attendance vs. brand attendance David

#### Explanation of the Census data

(Brian) Relationship between Census income and temple usage

### Additional data that you will leverage beyond that found in the SafeGraph (if any)

### What Constitutes Success

Our teams have identified some key aspects to indicate that our data manipulation and trend tracking were correct and could be used to predict future temples. We will know if it is successful if it predicts future and recently announced temples.
